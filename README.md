## AI Agent Collaboration

This project uses specialized AI agents to enhance development:

- **ComicBot**: Creative UX designer focused on comic reader experience, visual design, and reader engagement
- **TechAdvisor**: Technical architect focused on code quality, performance, security, and best practices

These agents work together to create features that are both delightful and technically excellent. Learn more about their collaboration in [.github/agents/AGENT_COLLABORATION.md](.github/agents/AGENT_COLLABORATION.md).

## Development

This is a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript application with no build process required. All assets are served directly.

### Chapter Data Management

The reader loads chapter data dynamically from `admin/data.json`. When you update chapters in the admin panel, changes are immediately reflected in the reader - no code changes needed!

**Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "chapters": {
    "Chapter 1": ["chapters/01/01.png", "chapters/01/02.png"],
    "Chapter 2": ["chapters/02/01.png"]
  }
}
```

### Contributing

To contribute or modify:
1. Edit `index.html` for structure and logic
2. Use the admin panel to manage chapter data (or edit `admin/data.json` directly)
3. Comic pages are organized in `/chapters/` directory
4. Test across different browsers and devices
